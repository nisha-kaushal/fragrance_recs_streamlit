It opens with a strong air-freshner type lemon scent, then dissipates to a caramel sugar with a hint of lemon. It's perfect for any time of year, and suitable to wear to the office!

It smells exactly as it sounds, like crisp apple juice. I like wearing this alone in the spring and summer, and  layer it with a cinnamon-y fragrance for the perfect fall fragrance.  My one qualm is that the longevity isn't as long as my other Kayali fragrances, but I still do get a good 5-6 hour wear time (as opposed to the usual 9+ from the other Kayali fragrances I own). "}}, "Cloud Ariana Grande": {"shiversort51982": {"rating": 3.5, "feedback": "A less-intense Baccarat Rouge dupe! It smells very sophisticated for a fragrance brand that you would assume would be for kids. Longevity wise, I can get 5-7 hours out of it, even longer on clothes. "}, "flashhurry63123": {"rating": 5, "feedback": "For a \"teen\" perfume, this is very sophisticated! Definitely smells similar to BR540, not exact but it is similar. Some people say it's too sweet but for me it smells more musky. It's pretty strong, so I would wear this when the weather is cold so it doesn't overwhelm anyone.\n"}}}
